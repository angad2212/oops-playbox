# OOPs Playbox — 10 Practical Coding Problems

This repository contains **10 hands-on C++ problems** designed to help you **master Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts — from fundamentals to High-level design problems.

Each problem focuses on one or more of the **core OOP pillars**:  
**Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism** — along with advanced design aspects like composition, interfaces, and real-world architecture.

## Problems Overview

| # | Topic | Concept Highlights |
|---|--------|--------------------|
| 1 | **Bank Account** | Encapsulation, Data Hiding |
| 2 | **Vehicle Hierarchy** | Inheritance, Overriding |
| 3 | **Shape Area Calculator** | Compile-time + Run-time Polymorphism |
| 4 | **Payment System** | Abstraction, Interfaces |
| 5 | **Library Management** | Composition (HAS-A Relationship) |
| 6 | **Logger (Singleton)** | Static Members, Design Pattern |
| 7 | **Student Copy Constructor** | Deep Copy, Rule of 3 |
| 8 | **Calculator & Scientific Calculator** | Overloading + Overriding |
| 9 | **Hotel Booking System** | Class Design, Encapsulation |
| 10 | **Ride-Sharing App (Uber Clone)** | Advanced OOP Design, Polymorphism, Interfaces |

## Goal
By completing all 10 problems, you’ll be able to:
- Write clean, modular OOP-based C++ code
- Understand real-world object relationships
- Confidently answer OOP design questions in **MAANG-level interviews**

## How to Use
1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/oops-playbox.git
   cd oops-playbox
2. Each problem is in its own folder:
   /Problem_01_BankAccount/
   /Problem_02_VehicleHierarchy/
   ...
   /Problem_10_RideSharingSystem/
3. Compile & run each problem:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o main && ./main
